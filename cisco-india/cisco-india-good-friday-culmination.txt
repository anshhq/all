Subject: I Have Questions

Multiple millions of innocent people lost jobs, worldwide. Million innocent helpless people dead.

But highly crooked, foxyü¶ä, wolf-yüê∫ political people, nothing happens to them, they neither perish nor gets punished. Just a general question, nothing in particular, to point out to.

Hope this Good Friday, Jesus resolve, bring salvation to, innocent people, who wrongly suffer, because of wicked ones. And faulty, unpunished scoundrels, who do seriously notorious things and who do highly unjustifiable deeds. The Jesus Christ, bring them to righteous justice, someday. If not on Earth. Then in their afterlife. #WeAreCisco #ChuckRobbins #CoronaVirus #COVID19
